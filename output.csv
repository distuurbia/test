<li>Walk through the room and discuss the teacher&rsquo;s use of print in the environment. Explain why it is important that materials and storage places are correctly labeled with words written conventionally in upper- and lowercase letters.</li>
<li>Discuss ways to add additional meaningful, functional, and interesting print to the classroom (e.g., create common signs such as Exit, Stop, Open, and Closed). With the teacher, create charts for taking attendance and identifying jobs on a daily basis. Review Intentional Teaching Card SE02, &ldquo;Look Who&rsquo;s Here!&rdquo; and Intentional Teaching Card SE12, &ldquo;Classroom Jobs&rdquo; with the teacher. Review the section on incorporating print throughout the environment in Volume 3.</li>

<li>Review the &ldquo;At-a-Glance&rdquo; chart for the upcoming week. Discuss activities that will produce meaningful print that can then be displayed in the classroom (e.g., a map of where the trash goes when it leaves the classroom).</li>
<li>Help the teacher enhance the word wall to incorporate new words and environmental print that is relevant to the current study topic or that reflects children&rsquo;s interests.</li>

<li>Look at the books that are displayed in the classroom. Invite the teacher to sort and stack books into categories (e.g., story, informational, alphabet, predictable, number and counting, nursery rhymes). Discuss which categories need more titles and suggest some titles for those categories. &bull; Draw the teacher&rsquo;s attention to the &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; section of the current Teaching Guide. Discuss the suggestions for additional children&rsquo;s books to consider. &bull; Discuss topics that you have observed children talking about (e.g., birds, insects, changes in weather). Suggest additional titles for the classroom library that might engage children in topics outside of the current study topic.</li>

<li>Discuss nonjudgmental, nonthreatening strategies for talking with families about challenging behaviors. Review the strategies for daily exchanges with families that are listed in Volume 1 with the teacher.</li>
<li>Encourage the teacher to keep detailed records of situations in which children&rsquo;s behavior is challenging.

<li>During your observations of the classroom, document behaviors that illustrate times when more encouragement would have helped children seek help and communicate their needs. Discuss and share ideas.</li>
<li>Model &ldquo;self-talk&rdquo; while in the classroom, (e.g., &ldquo;You know, I can&rsquo;t remember where the tape is kept. I&rsquo;m going to ask Ms. Jones for help.&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Discuss how and when providing hints, gestures, or cues to children is effective in helping them take care of their own needs appropriately (e.g., &ldquo;Look at where I&rsquo;m pointing. That helps remind you to put your drawing in your cubby. Do you remember what to say when you need help with something?&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Watch to make sure the teacher is gradually withdrawing support so that children can become more independent in seeking help and communicating their needs. At the beginning, suggest that the teacher do the task with the child. Later, encourage the teacher to gradually reduce the assistance, letting the child take more and more responsibility for the task.</li>
